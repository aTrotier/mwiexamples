# mwiexamples

Repository containing example usage for the package [MyelinWaterImaging.jl](https://github.com/jondeuce/MyelinWaterImaging.jl.git), an implementation of the Myelin Water Imaging (MWI) nonnegative least squares (NNLS) [toolbox](https://mriresearch.med.ubc.ca/news-projects/myelin-water-fraction/) written in the open-source [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
Julia is a free, easy to install, and *fast* open-source programming language.
For an introduction to Julia, see the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.3/).

This repository provides a simple example script `my_script.jl` for using the command line interface provided by MyelinWaterImaging.jl (see below):

```bash
$ julia my_script.jl <COMMAND LINE ARGS>
```

For an illustration of why one may be interested in using MyelinWaterImaging.jl and/or Julia, here is a comparison of the T2-distribution computation times between Julia and MATLAB:

<center>

| Dataset      | Image Size           | MATLAB      | Julia       |
| :---:        | :---:                | :---:       | :---:       |
| 48-echo CPMG | 240 x 240 x 48 x 48  | 2h:53m:13s  | **4m:25s**  |
| 56-echo CPMG | 240 x 240 x 113 x 48 | 9h:35m:17s  | **14m:36s** |

## Installation

### (Optional) cloning this repository

This repository provides example data and an example script `my_script.jl`.
It is not required to clone this repository to use MyelinWaterImaging.jl.

If you would like to make use of the example data and/or script, there are two ways to clone this repository:

1. Clone `mwiexamples` using `git` from the command line by executing the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/jondeuce/mwiexamples.git
    ```
2. Click the `Clone or download` button in the top right of this page to download a `.zip` file of the repository contents

### Downloading Julia

To use MyelinWaterImaging.jl, Julia version 1.3.0 or higher is required:

1. Visit the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and download Julia v1.3.0 or higher for your operating system.
2. After placing the downloaded folder (named e.g. `julia-1.3.0`) in an appropriate location, add the `julia` executable (located in e.g. `julia-1.3.0/bin/julia`) to your path

Julia 1.3.0 introduced [multithreading capabilities](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/07/multithreading), used by MyelinWaterImaging.jl, that greatly reduce computation time.

### Installing MyelinWaterImaging.jl

There are two ways to install MyelinWaterImaging.jl:

1.  Start `julia` from the command line, type `]` to enter the package manager REPL mode (the `julia>` prompt will be replaced by a `pkg>` prompt) and enter the following command:

    ```julia
    pkg> add https://github.com/jondeuce/MyelinWaterImaging.jl.git
    ```

    Once the package is finished installing, type the backspace key to exit the package manager REPL mode (the `julia>` prompt should reappear).
    Exit Julia using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+D`, or `âŒ˜-D` on OSX, or by typing `exit()`.

2. Use the example script `my_script.jl` provided by this repository which will automatically install MyelinWaterImaging.jl when used with the command line interface (see below).

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

This toolbox provides a command line interface (CLI) for processing from the terminal.
Using the CLI does not require any knowledge of Julia, only the installation steps above need to be completed.
One could compute myelin water fraction (MWF) maps using `julia` from the command line, and then continue on using the programming language of one's choice.

The CLI takes as input `.nii`, `.nii.gz`, or `.mat` files - or folders containing such files - and performs one or both of T2-distribution computation and T2-parts analysis, the latter of which performs post-processing of the T2-distribution to calculate parameters such as the MWF.
Data must be stored as (x, y, z, echo) for multi-echo input data, or (x, y, z, T2 bin) for T2-distribution input data.
See the [documentation](https://jondeuce.github.io/MyelinWaterImaging.jl/dev/cli) for more API details.

In order to call the command line interface one must first create a Julia script which loads MyelinWaterImaging.jl and calls the entrypoint function `main()`.
For example, the script `my_script.jl` provided by this repository contains a more heavily commented version of the following:

```julia
using Pkg # load the Julia package manager
if !in("MyelinWaterImaging", keys(Pkg.installed())) # check if installed
    Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/jondeuce/MyelinWaterImaging.jl.git"))
end
using MyelinWaterImaging # load the package
main() # call command line interface
```

This script will automatically check if MyelinWaterImaging.jl needs to be installed.
If you have already installed MyelinWaterImaging.jl using the first installation option, the first four lines can be omitted.

### Basic usage

The most straightforward usage is to call `julia` on a script such as `my_script.jl` above, passing in the input image and command line flags directly:

```bash
$ export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
$ julia my_script.jl data/images/image-175x140x1x56.nii.gz --T2map --T2part --TE 0.007 --output output/basic/
```

The first line sets the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to enable multithreading within Julia (4 threads in this example).
The second line calls `julia` on `my_script.jl` as follows:

* The 4D image file `data/images/image-175x140x1x56.nii.gz` is passed as the first argument
* The flags `--T2map` and `--T2part` are passed, indicating that both T2-distribution computation and T2-parts analysis (to compute e.g. the myelin water fraction) should be performed
* The flag `--TE` is passed with argument `0.007` in this example, setting the echo times to 7 ms, 14 ms, ...
* The flag `--output` is passed with a folder `output/basic/`; The folder output/basic will be created and the T2-distribution and T2-parts results will be stored there.

See the [arguments](https://jondeuce.github.io/MyelinWaterImaging.jl/dev/cli/#Arguments-1) section of the documentation for more information on command line arguments.

### Batch processing of input files

Multiple input files can be passed in for processing.
We can process all images in `data/images` as follows:

```bash
$ export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
$ julia my_script.jl data/images/ --T2map --T2part --TE 0.007 --output output/batchprocess/
```

These results will be stored in the folder `output/batchprocess/`.

### Passing parameters from a settings file

Flags and parameters can be passed in from settings file by prepending the `@` character to the path of the settings file.
Using the settings file in the `data/` folder, we can re-run the above example as follows:

```bash
$ export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
$ julia my_script.jl @data/example1/settings.txt
```

These results will be stored in the folder `output/example1/`, as per the settings file `data/example1/settings.txt`.

For more information on creating settings files, see the [documentation](https://jondeuce.github.io/MyelinWaterImaging.jl/dev/cli/#Settings-files-1).

### Example script

An example `bash` script `examples.sh` is provided by this repository which executes two example command line invocations, similar to those above.
The only requirement for this script to run is that the `julia` executable is on your path.
Run

```bash
$ ./examples.sh
```

at the terminal to execute the script.
Results will be stored in the `output/` directory.
